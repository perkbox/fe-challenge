## Brief

Please allow around 2 hours for this task.

Create a small job capture application. The screenshots have been included in this repository.
A user can have 1-3 jobs or be unemployed (0 jobs).

We are just looking for the component markup and structure.

- *We are **not** looking for logic or state management.*
- *Styling is also **not** important, use react-bootstrap or whichever UI framework you're most comfortable with.*
- *Feel free to include any reasonable 3rd party modules (MaterialUI etc.)*

## TS or JS, your choice

- At Perkbox, we use TypeScript as standard, however if you're more comfortable with using vanilla JavaScript, that's fine with us
- Using one over the other will not negatively reflect on your test result. We're more keen to see how you approach component reusability and code structure than the flavour of JS you choose


## Submission
Either share a GitHub repository with us or upload a zip file to a cloud storage of your choice, just make sure it's accessible (e.g. GoogleDrive, GitHub) (tip: don't include the node_modules folder!)
